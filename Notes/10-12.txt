Factorial Studies

Outcomes
* Interaction Effect: Occurs when two or more independent variables combine to produce an effect over and above their main effects

PxE Designs
* P = Person; Subject Variable
  * This is essentially a correlational analysis, and thus we cannot determine causation with correlation
* E = Environment; Manipulated Variable
* When you get a main effect of "E", researchers like this because it suggests the power of the environment is strong enough to produce the same behavior in different groups of people.
* Interactions in PxE are more interesting
