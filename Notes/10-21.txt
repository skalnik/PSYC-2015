Naturalistic Observation
* Goal: Study human or animal behavior as it occurs in natural settings in response to natural events, uninfluenced by the researcher
* Tries to maximize the ecological validity but has costs for minimized control
Dimensions of Naturalistic Observation
* Bouchard (1979)
  * Participation: THe degree to which the researcher/ observer takes part in the events being observed
    * Low participation: The observer just observes what goes on. These studies are more likely to involve group comparisons and quantitative data
    * High participation: The observer is apart of the environment. These studies will most likely use qualitative data and be similar to case studies
  * Deception: The degree to which the observer conceals his or her identity as the researcher
    * Completely Deception: Everyone in the environment is unaware of the observers participation in the study
    * Completely Informed: The individuals being observed are aware that someone is watching them.
Complete Participant
* The researcher becomes a full member of the research setting, without others being aware
Participant as Observer
* The researcher fully participates in the research setting but, all other individuals in the setting are fully informed to their true intention
