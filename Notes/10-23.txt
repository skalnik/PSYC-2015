Some History
* In the beginning of psychology, all research was small N designs
  * e.g., Ebbinghaus
* Instead of descriptive statistics (e.g., mean) researchers would report each individuals data in their reports.
* It wasn't until 1930s when Fischer developed the analysis of variance that researchers started doing large group studies
* Those who continued to use case study design were criticized for not being rigorous enough
* 1960s: Clinicians who were being trained in research methodology started to revert back to small N designs
* Why? 
  * Ethics of withholding treatment
  * Can't find large numbers for some diseases and conditions
* 1970s: Researches, especially clinicians began to use case studies again
