Correlational Research

Two Schools of Psychology
* Experimental
  * Hopes to show that some stimulus affects behavior in a predictable way, regardless of individual differences
  * Manipulates variables and observes outcomes
  * Looks for general laws that affect all people
* Correlational
  * Looks at relationships between naturally occurring variables and individual differences
  * Observe variables and relate them (no manipulation)
  * Looks at ways people differ from another
  * Looks at variance among organisms
* Cronbach was really concerned that correlational research held second-class status as a method in psychology
* He promoted the use of both along side each other
History of the Correlation
* Sir Francis Galton
* Cousin Darwin was interested in genetics and physical characteristics
* Inspired by this, galton was very interested in intelligence and was also concerned with the idea of eugenics
* As you can guess, this is a question of nature vs nurture, a term coined or inspired by Galton
* He assumed that intelligence was normally distributed like height
* Certainly, his research did suggest that intelligence and skills in specific areas (e.g., law, chemistry) did run in families.
* He also discovered and founded the notion of regression toward the mean
